! !INTRODUCTION:
!  \LaTeX
!  This is the main for the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM).
!  The whole model is steered by a number of namelist-files.
!  For the physical background of GOTM, see the GOTM report.
!
!  This main contains some initializations and the time loop.
!  From here, all necessary subroutines are called.
!
!  \section{The philosophy behind GOTM}
!
!  General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) is a very ambitious name for 
!  a one-dimensional water column model which simply allows for different 
!  combinations of momentum and tracer equations and a choice between some 
!  standard turbulence parameterizations.
!  A turbulence modeling expert might not find any new or sophisticated 
!  turbulence closure scheme in GOTM. Whoever is missing any feature in GOTM,
!  is invited to contribute to GOTM and add her or his personal preferences
!  or needs. GOTM is far from being complete and it will never be completed.
!  At some certain stage during the development of GOTM in winter 1998/99,
!  we decided to freeze innovations and to consolidate, comment and test what
!  was already included. The result of these efforts consists of the present
!  report, the GOTM source code, and the data and input files for some
!  test cases. All this is put together on this site of the world wide web.
!
!  For more information, see the GOTM report or http://www.gotm.net.
